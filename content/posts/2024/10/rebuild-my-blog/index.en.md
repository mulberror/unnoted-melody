This post is an experimental post of testing the related config of English web.

## Preface
I've once built a blog with the Hugo framework before, using the theme PaperMod.

But since most of the posts was lost, and I happened to come across [ryan4yin](https://thiscute.world/) 's blog, I learned about the [FixIt](https://github.com/HEIGE-PCloud/FixIt) theme made by [HEIGE-PCloud](https://pcloud.dev/).

The FixIt theme is very much in line with the style of blog I envisioned at the beginning, so it took me a while to rebuild my personal blog straight away, and in the meantime I also spent a little bit of time learning a little bit of front-end knowledge from scratch, and briefly wrote a humble personal homepage [My Little World](https://www.mulbry.top/).

## Version Information
- Hugo: v0.136.4
- FixIt: 0.4.X

## Hugo + Gitpage
### Local Configuration
This part should be quite familiar to every Hugo user, so I will briefly record it here.

First, install Go and Hugo, and configure it according to the official documentation [Hugo Document](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

After installing the dependencies, you can proceed with the local blog configuration.

I chose the [FixIt](https://github.com/HEIGE-PCloud/FixIt) theme and directly referred to the documentation written by the author [Theme Documentation - Basic Concepts](https://fixit.lruihao.cn/zh-cn/documentation/installation/).

However, since the author's documentation is applicable to FixIt version 0.2.X, I encountered a few issues while writing this article, which was also when I configured my blog.

### Deploying Gitpage
This part mainly follows the configuration tutorial in the Hugo official documentation [Host on GitHub Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).

I previously tried configuring three themes. If I simply pushed the static resources generated by `hugo server` in the `\public` directory directly to the GitHub repository, the rendered static pages would have various issues. Therefore, I adopted the deployment method from the official documentation.

According to the official configuration method, you generally only need to pay attention to replacing the branch information in `.github/workflows/hugo.yaml` and the Hugo version information in `HUGO_VERSION` with your corresponding values.

## Vercel
Vercel's functionality to sync and deploy projects from GitHub is very convenient.

After pushing local resources to the GitHub repository, Vercel will directly sync the resources, and the deployment speed is very fast.

Log in to Vercel with your GitHub account or register a Vercel account and link it to your GitHub account. Then click `Add New...` to import the blog deployed to Gitpage from the GitHub repository.

After importing, the project in Vercel is connected to the selected GitHub repository. As long as you commit once locally, the project in Vercel will be redeployed.

And each hosted project is given a separate url to connect to, so that it is easy to resolve your own domain name.

## Summary
I was going to write a paragraph on how to configure Cloudflare, but it's actually quite magical, thanks to my roommate. But it was quite a magical process, thanks to my roommate.

I'm going to write about this experience and some of the problems I encountered in configuring the blog in a separate post.
